# DeepLearning_Projects

Neural Networks from scratch, only using vectorized operations with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

The idea behind this repository is to develop a Production-ready Python library to work with simple Deep Neural Networks to understand
further how they work and make them more efficient.

### Things to try

- [ ] Changing numpy for an array GPU-accelerated computing library like CuPy
- [ ] Creating a little library
